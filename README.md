# Awesome-On-Device-AI-Inference üîçüì≤
This list highlights academic work focused on running AI models efficiently on resource-constrained mobile devices, such as smartphones and edge devices. This repo references [Awesome-On-Device-AI-Systems](https://github.com/jeho-lee/Awesome-On-Device-AI-Systems). We categorize target devices into (1) **Edge Devices** (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson), (2) **Smartphones** (e.g., Snapdragon/Exynos), (3) and **Microcontrollers** for energy-harvesting or batteryless IoT devices, with a primary focus on research conducted for edge devices and smartphones.
